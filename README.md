# SACLA_spacial_coherence
[SACLA XFEL](http://xfel.riken.jp/eng/) is the first synchrotron x-ray free electron laser in Japan. The research aims to get coherence properties about this synchrotron source. You can find more information in the presentation [`Estimation of spatial coherence of SACLA synchrotron`](https://github.com/dpaneke/SACLA_spacial_coherence/blob/master/Estimation_of_spatial_coherence_of_SACLA_synchrotron.pdf). Supporting programs are presented in the form of `MATLAB` code.
